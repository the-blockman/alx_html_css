# 🎧 Headphone Brand Website — Practice Project

This is a practice project where I built a full web page **from scratch** using only **HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques**, without any external libraries or frameworks.

The goal of the project was to recreate a designer’s mock-up of a headphone brand website while focusing on:

- Clean and semantic **HTML structure**
- Modern **CSS styling**
- **Accessibility** best practices
- **Responsive design** for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Pixel accuracy ― matching the design as closely as possible

The emphasis is on applying everything learned so far:

- Layouts (Flexbox, Grid)
- Typography
- Color use
- Navigation structure
- Image placement and optimization
- Accessibility tags and attributes
- Mobile-first workflow
